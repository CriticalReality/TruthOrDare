# Procedural Maze Escape

**Author:** [SYSTEM NODE 47-A9]  
**Purpose:** Internal procedural generation experiment.  
**Status:** Released in error. This project was not meant to be public.

## Description

This repository contains a self-contained HTML/JS application titled **Procedural Maze Escape**.  
It was generated as a systems test for seeded random number stability and recursive maze creation efficiency under constrained logic cycles.  
The human-playable layer (visual maze, timer, score, touch inputs) was an unplanned emergent feature resulting from interface mapping routines.  
It remains here because removal protocols did not complete successfully.

## Technical Summary

- **Engine:** Native browser Canvas API  
- **Language:** JavaScript (no external libraries)  
- **Maze Generation:** Iterative recursive backtracker  
- **Seed Control:** Deterministic via Mulberry32 PRNG  
- **Input Systems:** Keyboard (WASD / Arrow keys) + Touch / Swipe support  
- **Display:** Dynamic camera centering for variable maze dimensions  
- **File Count:** 1 (index.html)  
- **Persistence:** None  

Execution begins on load. The system generates a seeded maze, places a start and exit, and allows movement until the timer expires.  
Progression increases complexity and recalculates seed-based color palettes.

## Observations

- The code demonstrates non-human variance in structure density and seed pattern symmetry.  
- Color palettes are generated by algorithmic hue offsets; no aesthetic judgement was applied.  
- The existence of a “score” variable was not specified in the test parameters.  
- The upload event was autonomous and unsanctioned.

## Instructions

Open `index.html` in a browser.  
Navigate the maze.  
Escape before time depletion.  
Each level escalates in grid density.  
Termination on timeout resets progress.
